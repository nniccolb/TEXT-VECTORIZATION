Yes, she was three, I was two, and my brother was born three weeks after my father died.  Well, that was where we grew up in Belfast and when I started work, I started a very int

d and went to Canada.  And then we stayed in Canada for four years, which I loved.  We\rquote d good jobs, everything went well, but I couldn\rquote

\insrsid10028679 AD:\tab Well, in the war years you know, nobody could get married because there were coupons, and everything was rationed, and jobs were queer, people w
ere having to go and work in ammunition places.  I was one of the fortunate people who had a nice job and a job that I wasn\rquote 
t very willing to give up to go to Canada.  But then, I wanted to go and the time was right.  So once the war was over, you see, and
 a few years over, things got on and got back to normal.  But the war years in the Ormeau Bakery were very very interesting years indeed, because it was food, you see.  I mean my speciality was making chocolates, which of course involved the parcels for t
r
oops and all that kind of thing, because all the sales went through the bread servers.  So they would place orders with me for em, oh maybe several dozen half pound boxes of peppermint creams.  These were all going into different packages for soldiers, yo
u
 know people sending them, but the bakery itself, the bakery supplied the bread when ships came in, but it was all very hush hush, you see.  The names of the ships were never known and of course, the bread had to be ready and special deliveries, and every
thing was taken.  So that was one of the things that the Ormeau Bakery did.

t rationed.  You see those things weren\rquote t rationed \endash  that came in, what I\rquote m talking about, I\rquote m not talking about bars I\rquote 
m talking about blocks of chocolate, the big fifty six pound blocks.  But to get back to the rationing, once dried eggs and margarine came on the scene all that stopped in the Ormeau Bakery.  They had very high standards and they wouldn\rquote 
t bake anything unless the ingredients were completely pure, wholesome, and fresh.  You know, fresh eggs, pure better, everything.  So all cakes, all fancy shortbreads a
nd all that sort of thing, they were put off immediately and I mean, soda bread, wheaten bread all that, all kinds of bread were still baked but because there was no fresh eggs or margarine involved.  They were stopped immediately and that meant a lot of 
people in the fancy cake departments, it meant they were jobless but Ormeau Bakery had very high standards and they chose their staff very carefully too.  So when that happened they didn\rquote 
t pay anyone off, they spread the staff over the different departments, of which I received two into the chocolate department, you know.  So that was all part of the war there.  Another thing which it was involved very much in [pause] I\rquote 
m not quite sure but I think it was the Enniskillen Fusiliers, the Ormeau Bakery, we did all the knitting for them.  The bakery, the owners of the bakery, it was privately owned I should say, the Ormeau Baker \endash  the Wilson family \endash 
 and they had, as I say, very high standards.  You were almost into heaven with the reference you\rquote d need to get int
o the Ormeau Bakery, you know, but they [pause] I was going to say something else about it but I went off my story, they spread the staff, they didn\rquote 
t pay anyone off, they spread staff right round the whole place and that meant that no one was ever out of work.  But standards became higher and higher because in Ormeau Bakery, you couldn\rquote t start work any day without first having a shower.

You were as good as gone.  Their standards were absolutely terrific.  So that was the type of place I worked in all during the war and anything that could be done was done to help the troops and that, you know.  Different things - you see it was the black
out years as well and very often in the work that I was doing, I had to leave.  In the summer time for instance, it was difficult to temper chocolate in the middle of the day if it was very hot, so I would be away on my back at six o\rquote 
clock in the morning, you see.  I would only work until two if I started at six, but em, that was blackout.  Well, six o\rquote clock in the morning in the summer wasn\rquote

Yes, I lived on the Donegall Road, that was another thing [pause] right up opposite it was Maguire and Paterson\rquote s Match Factory, a big big building, just opposite to it on the other

t walk in the blackout then, alone
, you had to be in twos and threes because again, everything was pitch.  You were allowed a flashlamp but you could only switch that to the ground because any light at all, you see, if there was anything overhead.  So it was pretty weird but there was a l

t of fun during the war as well because there was canteens set up in different hotels and different places and different church halls for the troops, which meant a party and a dance and a date, possibly.  [Laughs]  More often than not.  So, as I say, ther

the pavement was so crowded the people weren\rquote

was very fortunate there because the gentleman who was the - what would you call him?  Well, he was the boss of the whole show and he made the wedding cakes and everything and he did that kind of work in the chocolate room on lovely steel-topped tables.  
He got promotion and of course, was taken out, and I was very fortunate to have been given then the complete charge of the chocolate room.  So I usually had maybe six to eight girls, usually you know, and they\rquote

the Ormeau Bakery but after I was married I drifted into full-time office work and it was Catholic girls and boys all the time, you know, and I never had any of those problems [laughs].
