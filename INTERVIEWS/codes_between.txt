{"0": {"text": "Well, my name is Alice D. That’s my married name, of course, my maiden name was S., Alice S. and I was born in Belfast. My father died when I was only two years old so my very young mother, twenty-three, was a widow. My brother was born after he died and she brought the three of us up. In those days, there was no widow’s pensions or anything like that so it was all hard work. How old was your sister when your father died? She would have been three. So she had three children under four? Yes, she was three, I was two, and my brother was born three weeks after my father died. Well, that was where we grew up in Belfast and when I started work, I started a very interesting job. I loved it, making chocolates. I started with a small firm, first of all, Thompsons of Belfast, but I moved from there to the Ormeau Bakery in 1939, the war years, you know and I was there from thirty nine to fifty three, when I got married and went to Canada. And then we stayed in Canada for four years, which I loved. We’d good jobs, everything went well, but I couldn’t stand the humidity and the heat in the summer time so we came back. However, my time in the Ormeau Baker I would say were amongst the happiest years; they were all happy. They were very special years. I think it was because it was wartime. How old were you when you started work? I was twenty-six when I went into the Ormeau Bakery and I was forty when we left to go to Canada. And you see I wasn’t married until I was forty. Sensible woman, you waited. [Both laugh] Well, in the war years you know, nobody could get married because there were coupons, and everything was rationed, and jobs were queer, people were having to go and work in ammunition places. I was one of the fortunate people who had a nice job and a job that I wasn’t very willing to give up to go to Canada. But then, I wanted to go and the time was right. So once the war was over, you see, and a few years over, things got on and got back to normal. But the war years in the Ormeau Bakery were very very interesting years indeed, because it was food, you see. I mean my speciality was making chocolates, which of course involved the parcels for troops and all that kind of thing, because all the sales went through the bread servers. So they would place orders with me for em, oh maybe several dozen half pound boxes of peppermint creams. These were all going into different packages for soldiers, you know people sending them, but the bakery itself, the bakery supplied the bread when ships came in, but it was all very hush hush, you see.

So that was one of the things that the Ormeau Bakery did. How would they have managed, with rationing, to produce things like sweets? Well, sweets weren’t, it was a fondant type of thing, you know, and chocolate wasn’t rationed. You see those things weren’t rationed – that came in, what I’m talking about, I’m not talking about bars I’m talking about blocks of chocolate, the big fifty six pound blocks. But to get back to the rationing, once dried eggs and margarine came on the scene all that stopped in the Ormeau Bakery. They had very high standards and they wouldn’t bake anything unless the ingredients were completely pure, wholesome, and fresh. You know, fresh eggs, pure better, everything. So all cakes, all fancy shortbreads and all that sort of thing, they were put off immediately and I mean, soda bread, wheaten bread all that, all kinds of bread were still baked but because there was no fresh eggs or margarine involved. They were stopped immediately and that meant a lot of people in the fancy cake departments, it meant they were jobless but Ormeau Bakery had very high standards and they chose their staff very carefully too. So when that happened they didn’t pay anyone off, they spread the staff over the different departments, of which I received two into the chocolate department, you know. So that was all part of the war there. Another thing which it was involved very much in [pause] I’m not quite sure but I think it was the Enniskillen Fusiliers, the Ormeau Bakery, we did all the knitting for them. The bakery, the owners of the bakery, it was privately owned I should say, the Ormeau Baker – the Wilson family – and they had, as I say, very high standards. You were almost into heaven with the reference you’d need to get into the Ormeau Bakery, you know, but they [pause] I was going to say something else about it but I went off my story, they spread the staff, they didn’t pay anyone off, they spread staff right round the whole place and that meant that no one was ever out of work. But standards became higher and higher because in Ormeau Bakery, you couldn’t start work any day without first having a shower. That was unusual? Yes, without having a shower and woe betide you if you didn’t and you were told on, you know. You were as good as gone. Their standards were absolutely terrific. So that was the type of place I worked in all during the war and anything that could be done was done to help the troops and that, you know.

Oh, it was a wonderful place to work. And did you leave when you got married because you had to leave or because you were going to Canada? Because I was going to Canada, yes. Was your husband Canadian? No, no, my husband was an accountant but I had cousins in Canada and we had waited so long here with the war and one thing or another, and we’d always wanted to go. So we said we’d get married and go. So we went the day we got married, had our honeymoon on the liner. [Laughs] Moonlight on the Atlantic and sunset on the St. Laurence, I used to say. [Both laugh] Just to go back again, I’m interested in - you left school at fourteen, was that because money was so tight? Well that was the school leaving age then. You see, there wasn’t the opportunities then there are now. I mean when I was leaving school the president of our public elementary school came to my mother and said that they would pay half the fees if she could raise the half to allow me to go on to be a teacher. And my mother said I’m waiting for her to go to work – that’s just what it was.

Yes, it would be used you know for filling. Well, this would be in a big copper thing with a big, big spout.

I said there’s an error in my pay packet, there’s extra money in it and they said oh well, I was given that instruction, you’d better talk to Miss Grahame.

Oh no, it wasn’t formal overtime; it was because of the work you had done. They showed their appreciation of it.

But she did [pause] when I came back from Canada the first time, she entertained me in their home, which was another thing that was practically unheard of, you know. Oh, Alice S., as I was in the Bakery you know, Alice S. was up in Miss Grahame’s. I don’t know what it was, I always think that the years that I sat in those shop windows, you know, sixteen and of a Saturday night, shops were open to ten o’clock in those days. And I’m sitting in the window and everybody’s looking at me, and I think that gave me a confidence that I might never have had as I got older. Because I’ve noticed that throughout my life, I’m pretty active in church and the choice – my husband was organist and choir master – that if I’ve ever been asked to do anything, for instance read or talk, it doesn’t bother me. I often think it was that, it got me over a hurdle of being afraid to face people. It was quite a big thing for a sixteen-year-old to be put on public view like that? Yes, wasn’t it? Were you given a choice? No, I was told that I was going to have to do it and that it was because I was the right person. There was a lot of compliments, you know, when they were choosing me for this reason, for various reasons, how I looked and the way I worked and I was capable of it. No there wasn’t anyone else, like. Was it just one shop where they did this? Oh no, it was different weekends I would be sometimes in Cornmarket, sometimes Anne Street, very often Donegall Place and they had a lovely big one on the Antrim Road and I was there once or twice. I was always enjoying it, it never was a chore to me, you know. I think if you’re good at something, it makes all the difference. If you’re struggling, it’s different, so it is. Well, it wouldn’t have been much of an advertisement if you were making a mess of it in the window? [Both laugh] But that must have created more pressure? Yes.

So she and her husband when they were sort of boy and girl going together, my husband and I were the same, and we had a foursome many is the time.

There wasn’t a sports club but we had a table tennis table in the canteen, which I was on every minute I could get, you know.

Would there have been more women than usual working there, because of that sort of thing – men going off to the services? No, I wouldn’t have thought - no, women would never have put into a position that a man had vacated. Even on a temporary basis? Well, maybe on a temporary basis.

All my siblings, my brothers and sisters – I’m the eldest of six, they were all in the sea scouts, I was the only one who wasn’t. And they’ve never severed the connections. But what other activities would you have done, you know when you say they were musical? They entered us for musical competitions, you know, taught us to sing properly and taught us some lovely things. Things I only hear people singing now and I can recall having been taught them. Is that where your interest in choir came from? Well it would be I suppose part of it, yes, because I was quite young then and automatically went into the church choir. What about your mother – would she have any involvement in guide activities or anything else you were doing? No, my mother didn’t. She had grown up - her mother died when she was quite young. She was left with three brothers so there was no time for organisations for her, sort of living at home and then going to work when she was the age. So she had a pretty hard life, all told. Was it expected by her family that she would look after her brothers? Oh yes, she did. What about home social activities? I know you were saying that during the war years you had a great social life, entertaining the troops, but when you were young, did you have friends in and how would you entertain yourselves in the evenings? In those days, you stayed young much younger than boys and girls do now. I mean a skipping rope was my full joy until I was maybe fourteen or something, you know. And I walked a lot and when we were with the guides you see, although it was only one night a week, we were meeting for nature study, which I loved, you know.

There was badges to do; I did my nature study badge because I was keen and it stayed with me right until now for I love the change of seasons and everything now, you know. I learnt to love the entire creation through the guides. And when you were older yourself were you ever tempted to go back and become a leader? I sort of - I think I started to go with a boy, I think that was what it was [both laugh]. And I came out when I thought I was past uniform you know, and black stockings and all that sort of thing. And of course I was in the church choir by that time. What about earlier? Were your family churchgoers? Yes, we were. Your mother would take you to Sunday services? Yes, she did. When we were young we all went together. Were there any other activities associated with the church? We were so much in the guides - there was a girls club you know and all that kind of thing but it didn’t attract me like the guides did, so it didn’t. Except Sunday School, of course. How long did you keep that up for? I was going to Sunday School until I was about seventeen and then the conditions that I got leaving on was that I would go to an afternoon service in the City Y.M. on a Sunday afternoon. It was all part of growing up; that was what we did. That was a condition your mother laid down? It was yes. So she was quite strict about it? Oh she was, yes, about Sunday. And how about your friends, would they have come from similar backgrounds? Yes, we were. Some of them were better off, you know, from the standpoint that they had fathers, mothers, working and that. But you sort of made a friend in the class you were in and that was it, you know. What about - as far as I can tell from talking to people in the Catholic community, they didn’t really go outside of their immediate neighbourhood. They didn’t really see the other side, for want of a better description. Would that have been true of your experience of childhood? You mean from a Protestant/Catholic point of view? Yes, you know that you were going to school in a Protestant school and you went to a Protestant church, did you see Catholic children at any point? Well, strangely, my mother’s closest friend when we were young children was a Catholic lady and we went as a family and visited each other’s homes.

So these were Catholic girls and a Catholic family and Mrs. Smith’s husband died and by that time my mother was expecting Frank. So you see my mother had the third child but they were both left widows. They were very young. But I remember walking - it was quite a walk to where they lived, you know, to visit. We always went to visit their home, so we did, there was never any Catholic/Protestant thing much, we were all people, and we grew up with them and knew them well. And I think with me it has been like that throughout my life because not in the Ormeau Bakery but after I was married I drifted into full-time office work and it was Catholic girls and boys all the time, you know, and I never had any of those problems [laughs]. The Ormeau Bakery was mainly a Protestant workforce? It was completely Protestant. It seems very similar to the Guinness’s Brewery in Dublin where there was a large Catholic workforce but all of the management positions were filled by Protestants. I suppose it’s natural that a minority group would chose to look after each other. With the Catholic women who never went outside of their own area - it wasn’t so much that the Catholic women had any prejudice but that all of their activities were so connected with people in their own area that they never actually met anyone outside their own community. We knew the Smiths - I actually call them Smith Mulholland, that was her married name but because Evelyn and Norah were about the same age and then Molly and myself, you know and my mother kept up the friendship for years until Mrs. Smith died. But I can well remember walking - you see, you walked everywhere in those days. I mean with my mother’s hand, we were as young as that when we went to visit them.

Yes, our school was attached to the church. You see, it was an elementary school. And what sort of classes, what size classes would you have had? We didn’t talk about P1, P2 and P3 and all in those days, you know, we talked about the infants and then a second, third and fourth class which we talked about, was downstairs.

For myself, do you mean? Yes, when you were going through school were there any special classes other than doing the very basic education? No, I never remember there being any special class for anything, but as far as the three Rs were concerned I had no problems ever at school.

But for me, school was no problem. I enjoyed school, enjoyed everything about it. What about things like school lunches? Did you eat in school, did you bring a packed lunch? Yes, we often took a packed lunch, probably bread and butter and jam, very often it was sandwiches and you carried that with you. We only got half an hour then, anyway, you know, at school. It was a break just of a half hour, so it was, like from twelve to half twelve or thereabouts and then coming back from one to three.
